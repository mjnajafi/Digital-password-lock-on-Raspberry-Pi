# Digital-password-lock-on-Raspberry-Pi
Raspberry Pi project using Keypad &amp; LCD 

In this Project:
When you press True Password, LED will turn on.
otherwise, If you press False Password, LCD print "False Password" and you can try again!

instead of LED, with some changes; you can design a circuit in order to control a physically lockdoor which only open with true password!


If you have any question, feel free and contact me!


Good Luck!
